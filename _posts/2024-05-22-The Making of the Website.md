# Introduction

In this post I will be sharing my journey and thought process in making this website.

previosuly i dont have a good place to share all of these. I tried with linked in with this post (link) but present with two major problems. Limited customisability of each and not suitable to display code and the second is that the throught my writing, i always have a conflict of how detailed and the audience of my article. I could make it simple and easy to understand but that would mean. So with this website, i am aiming for a more deatiled posts and with a more technical audience. 

moving forward this will be the place that i will yap about my projects and discoveries 


Motivation:

My main motivation in making this is the fact that a lot of my projects are left and forgotten. Things that i thought i will remember for a long time i will literally forgot

I dont give enough credit cause sometimes when i look back i dont remember much on what i did especially for small one off weekend project. For

I learnt a lot but i dont document them so sometimes i just forget 

Not only that, even for long term projects i tend to forget the struggle and the effort i put into it

for example, the embedded systems project, i remembered there were so much interesting stuff that i thought i wouldnt forget but now few months passed and i already forgot a lot of the details. Sure I

I believe this is an important part of engineering

sometimes i revisit a project and end up looking at google with a bunch of purple links (which means i have googled them before) but i ended up needing to re-do the things i shouldve discovered

things like design justification, why i choose this specific approach and things like that are the kinds of i most often forget about

not only that, i believe that techincla communication is important for engineers as i belive that your idea is only good only if you can explain them especially when working with other engineers so with this i
will try my best to improve my technical explanation skill. I appreciate and love a good well written explanation of something complex, so i would like to have such writing skills




## Requirements

So to start, i have to set some some requirements for my website

I want something that just works. Although i have learned a bit about web development in the past, using a web framework and designing my own website would just take too much time and takes

good readability and good design -> i tried beign a which leads to the use of templates

free with option of self hosting -> using online web maker is an option but paying for subscription isnt really good and I would want to be able to host my own server in the future

easy to post -> writing custom html file for each post is really not practical. I dont mind not having full customisability as long as the options that i have is enough - somehing like a markdown file for each post is perfect



## Options
